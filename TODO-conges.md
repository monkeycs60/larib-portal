- We cannot change month in the calendar (server error + redirection to dashboard) surely because of application link (locale is repeated twice ) GET /en/en/conges?month=2025-09 404 in 53ms
- 'Request leave' button must have different name for admins: 'Declare leave' ; and the submission must be auto-accepted (because it is admin)
